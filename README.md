# Introduction

ELF parser in pure ruby implementation. This work is inspired by [pyelftools](https://github.com/eliben/pyelftools) by [Eli Bendersky](https://github.com/eliben).

The truly motivation to create this repository is want to be a dependency of [pwntools-ruby](https://github.com/peter50216/pwntools-ruby). Since a ELF parser is a big work, it should not be implemented directly in pwntools.
